##   🕵️☝&nbsp;&nbsp; Assignment Overview:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;➡️ &nbsp;&nbsp;#️⃣1️⃣ &nbsp;Building a Fully RESTful API
Your primary task is to develop a fully RESTful API. This API should be capable of handling all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a designated endpoint. The goal here is to demonstrate proficiency in creating a robust and responsive API.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;➡️ &nbsp;&nbsp;#️⃣2️⃣ &nbsp;Implementing Advanced Features
Since this course focuses on 'Advanced' server-side languages, we're introducing an additional layer of complexity. In this section, you will enhance your API by integrating three key functionalities:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 📌&nbsp; **Filtering:** Implement a system that allows users to filter the returned data based on specific criteria.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 📌&nbsp; **Sorting:** Develop a sorting mechanism to organize data in a meaningful order based on user preferences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 📌&nbsp; **Pagination:** Introduce pagination to efficiently manage and navigate through large datasets.

> 🗣️💬&nbsp; **emily says...**&nbsp;&nbsp; 12/14 isn't bad! I really tried to get them all to pass but, maybe next time. Before starting on the coding of my routes, I set up a psuedo code that outlines everything to keep myself on track. You can find this markdown file [here](link). I kept the majority of my comments and notes in my actual routes file as well.
