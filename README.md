### 💤 🛜 📁 &nbsp;&nbsp; RESTful Routes Using ExpressJS 
This repository houses my assignment for Advanced Server-Side Languages. You can find the required video demonstration linked below, hosted privately to Youtube. All nessecary files have been pushed to this branch.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;➡️ &nbsp;&nbsp;#️⃣1️⃣ &nbsp;Building a Fully RESTful API
Your primary task is to develop a fully RESTful API. This API should be capable of handling all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a designated endpoint. The goal here is to demonstrate proficiency in creating a robust and responsive API.
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;➡️ &nbsp;&nbsp;#️⃣2️⃣ &nbsp;Implementing Advanced Features
Since this course focuses on 'Advanced' server-side languages, we're introducing an additional layer of complexity. In this section, you will enhance your API by integrating three key functionalities:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 👌&nbsp;**Filtering:** Implement a system that allows users to filter the returned data based on specific criteria.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 👌&nbsp;**Sorting:** Develop a sorting mechanism to organize data in a meaningful order based on user preferences.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 👌&nbsp;**Pagination:** Introduce pagination to efficiently manage and navigate through large datasets.
